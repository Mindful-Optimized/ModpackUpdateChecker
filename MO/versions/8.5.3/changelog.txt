[Emotes n Speed Update]

Tweaks, Speed & Emotes
Fabric Loader is now 0.14.24
EMOTES!! `B` key

The first time your launch it will be significantly slower. Because it needs to create a cache which contains all the assets minecraft normally loads. This will also happen every time you change a mod/resourcepack if that configuration does not have an existing cache. But after that you should see much faster game loading.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed crashes during random entity property in ETF
- Fixed muffled and play sound button tooltips being just bad
- Fixed Game sometimes crashing when joining a server
- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state 
- Fixed Incendium Resourcepack
- Fixed Dynamic Lights
- Fixed crash when resources reload
